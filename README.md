## **Project Overview**
**Book Inventory Analysis** is an end-to-end analytics project that combines **web scraping, SQL insights, and Python-based data visualization** to extract and analyze book data from [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/). The project demonstrates the full workflow from raw web data extraction to actionable business insights.  

**Key Skills Applied:**  
- Web Scraping with Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests)  
- Data Storage and Analysis using SQL  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Web Scraping (Python)**
- Scraped book details from all pages on the website, including:  
  - **Title**  
  - **Price**  
  - **Availability**  
  - **Rating (out of 5 stars)**  
- Stored the extracted data in a **CSV file** for further analysis.  

---

### **2. SQL Insights**
- Loaded the CSV into a **SQL database** to derive key insights:  
  1. Count of books available in stock  
  2. Top 5 most expensive books  
  3. Average book rating  
  4. Distribution of books across different ratings (1 to 5 stars)  

**Sample Insights:**  
- There are **X** books in stock  
- The most expensive book is **‚ÄúXYZ‚Äù**, priced at **¬£59.99**  
- Average rating of books is **4.2 stars**  
- **Y** books have a **5-star rating**  

---

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**
- Performed EDA using **Pandas** to summarize dataset characteristics (count, average price, missing values)  
- Visualized key insights using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**:  
  - **Bar chart:** Number of books per rating  
  - **Histogram:** Distribution of book prices  
  - **Pie chart:** Proportion of books in stock vs out of stock  
  - Additional visualizations highlighting trends and patterns  

---

## **Outcome & Learning**
- Gained hands-on experience in **web scraping and data extraction**  
- Applied **SQL for structured data analysis**  
- Developed skills in **data visualization and EDA** to generate actionable insights  
- Learned to integrate **Python, SQL, and visualization** for end-to-end analytics projects
